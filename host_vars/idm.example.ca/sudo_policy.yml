# This file defines the sudo policy for the idm deployment
# sudo commands are invidual commands that a user should be able to use
# sudo command groups are groups of sudo commands that we may want to assign together
# sudo rules define the 'who' gets to access on 'which hosts' to perform 'what commands' as 'which users'
#  - it also defines sudo options and the priority of a given rule w.r.t. other rules.
